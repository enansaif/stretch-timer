# stretch-timer
A simple Linux utility that promotes healthier screen time by reminding you to take regular breaks, stretch, and reset. It starts a focus session when you begin using your PC, notifies you after 45 minutes, and automatically locks your screen if you donâ€™t take a break within the next 15 minutes.
